  storyText: "Welcome to WTG Industries!  \n\nCongratulations!  Your training is
    now complete!  As a new employee, you'll be expected to perform a series of menial
    tasks and obey company policies like all of the other drones.\n\nYou will be
    offered an employee handbook.  You are encouraged to read the employee handbook
    thoroughly and refer to it often.  Failure to do so may diminish your chances
    of success in our fine company!\n\nIf you are successful at work, the company
    will make huge profits using your best ideas, though you probably will not earn
    much at all.  \n\nFailure to be successful may result in a series of disciplinary
    actions to include: verbal warnings, a slap on the wrist, demerits, loss of dignity,
    shaming, embarrassment, written warnings, physical assault, imprisonment, *termination,
    or depending on the severity of the offense, possible summary execution.  \n\nFortunately,
    you cannot get fired.  \n\nWe hope you will enjoy working for our company as
    much as we plan to enjoy your company here at our company.   \n\nDon\u2019t forget
    to read your employee handbook, and remember, we have **free donuts on Friday!
    \n"
